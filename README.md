# About
This is a **Kaggle competition** hosted by Vanderbilt University and The Learning Agency Lab (October 31,2023 to January 23,2024). Developed a machine learning model to accurately **differentiate essays written by students from those generated by large language models**, addressing concerns about plagiarism and the impact of LLMs on education.

# DataSet Details
The competition dataset comprises about **10,000 essays**, some written by students and some generated by a variety of large language models (LLMs). The goal of the competition is to determine whether or not essay was generated by an LLM.

- All of the essays were written in response to one of **seven essay prompts**.
  
-  **Training Data:** Essays from **two of the prompts** compose the training set; the remaining essays compose the hidden test set. Nearly all of the training set essays   
  were written by students, with only a few generated essays given as examples. You may wish to generate more essays to use as training data.

-  **Testing Data:** The data in test_essays.csv is only dummy data.There are about **9,000 essays** in the test set, both student written and LLM generated.

# Accuracy
- **Public Score:** 0.963797 (Calculated on 46% of test data)
- **Private Score:** 0.908580 (Calculated on 54% of test data)

# Leaderboard Details
We secured **Silver medal** in this competition **ranking 125 out of 4359** participants **globally**, representing the **Top 3%** of the teams

# Data Reading
- Data Loading and Preprocessing for Text Classification
1. **Data Loading**: We load the data from the following CSV files:
    - `train_v2_drcat_02.csv` for Training data
    - `test_essays.csv` for Testing data
    - `sample_submission.csv` for sample submission format
2. **Data Cleaning**: 
    - Duplicate rows in the training data are removed based on the 'text' column
   
      `train = train.drop_duplicates(subset=['text'])`
    - Additionally, certain prompts are excluded from the training set.
      
      `excluded_prompt_name_list = ['Distance learning','Grades for extracurricular activities','Summer projects']`
3. **Preprocessing**: Preprocessing steps such as setting lowercase conversion and defining the vocabulary size are applied.

# Byte Pair Encoding
- Creating Byte-Pair Encoding Tokenizer with Hugging Face
1. Initialization of the raw tokenizer with BPE model and special tokens.
2. Addition of normalization and pre-tokenization processes, such as NFC normalization and byte-level pre-tokenization.
3. Training of the tokenizer using a trainer instance and a provided dataset.
4. Creation of a Hugging Face dataset object from a pandas DataFrame.
5. Iterative training of the tokenizer from the dataset using a custom corpus iterator.
6. Initialization of a PreTrainedTokenizerFast object using the trained raw tokenizer.
7. Tokenization of test and train text data using the tokenizer.

# TF-IDF
- TF-IDF Vectorization with Custom Vocabulary
1. **Function Definition**: A dummy function `dummy` is defined, which simply returns the input text.
2. **Vectorizer Initialization**: The `TfidfVectorizer` is initialized with specific parameters such as ngram_range, lowercase, sublinear_tf, and the use of the dummy function for tokenization and preprocessing.
3. **Fitting and Vocabulary Extraction**: The vectorizer is fitted on tokenized texts from the test dataset, and the resulting vocabulary is extracted.
4. **Vectorization with Custom Vocabulary**: Another `TfidfVectorizer` is initialized with the vocabulary extracted in the previous step, ensuring that the same vocabulary is used for both training and test data vectorization.
5. **Vectorization of Texts**: The training and test datasets are transformed into TF-IDF representations using the vectorizer.
6. **Memory Management**: The vectorizer object is deleted, and garbage collection is triggered to manage memory usage.

# Ensemble Model
1. **Model Definition**: The `get_model()` function defines an ensemble of classifiers:
    - Multinomial Naive Bayes
    - Stochastic Gradient Descent
    - LightGBM
    - CatBoost.
2. **Initialization**: The ensemble model is initialized with specific parameters and weights assigned to each base classifier.
3. **Model Training**: If the number of texts in the test dataset is more than 5, the ensemble model is trained on the TF-IDF transformed training data (`tf_train`) along with labels (`y_train`).
4. **Prediction**: The trained model is used to predict probabilities for the test dataset (`tf_test`), and the predictions are stored in the 'generated' column of the submission dataframe (`sub`).
5. **Saving Predictions**: The submission dataframe with predictions is saved to a CSV file named 'submission.csv'.
